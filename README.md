# Cats vs Dogs Classifier with VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
This project builds a binary image classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs using TensorFlow Keras and the VGG16 pre-trained model.

## Dataset.
For dataset please refer to : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

## Overview.
The sole objective of this repository is to get better and in-depth understanding of pre-trained models and transfer learning.
this project uses VGG-16 as a pre trained model for existing parameters. It is built using **Python and Keras along with tensorflow.**

##  Features
- Building and training VGG-16 model
- Training last convulutional layer
- Predicting Cat and Dog images
